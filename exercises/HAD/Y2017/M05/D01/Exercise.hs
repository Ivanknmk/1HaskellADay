It's hard to keep within a budget, ...

... [let that sink in] ...

Maura discovered as she prepared her class's May Day party. She had been 
assigned money from the common fund, and she spent half of it plus $2.00 for a
nice cake. Then she spent half of what she had left plus $2.00 for a baskets and
flowers. Then she spent half of what she had left plus $1.00 for candy. At that
point she was out of money. How much had she started with?

Side question: what was hard about keeping within the budget if, as this problem
states, Maura kept within the budget?

Assumption: she spent whole dollars on each purchase.
