Okay, we're going explore a bit of probability and see where that takes us.

These problems are from Fifty Challenging Problems in Probability with Solutions
by Frederick Mosteller.

Problem 1

A drawer contains red socks and black socks. When two socks are drawn at random,
the probability that both are red is 1/2.
--}

-- (a) How small can the number of socks in the drawer be?

totalSocks :: Int
totalSocks = undefined

-- (b) How small if the number of black socks is even?

totalSocksGivenEvenBlack :: Int
totalSocksGivenEvenBlack = undefined

Okay, serious question to you red-or-black sock owners.

(1) Who has a drawer full of RED SOCKS? Is this some College professor-thing?

(2) Who, after a week, hasn't figured out you put the RED SOCKS on the LEFT side
    of the drawer and BLACK SOCKS on the RIGHT side of the drawer, so your 
    probability of drawing two red socks is 100% because you're not a dummy?

    It's called algebraic types, and it's good for more than just Haskell.
    Just saying.

    But no, that's okay: arrange your sock drawer in whichever way your heart 
    desires.
