From the Mensa Genius Quiz-a-Day Book by Dr. Abbie F. Salny, July 3 problem:

The following multiplication example uses all the digits from 0 to 9 once and
only once (not counting the intermediate steps). Finish the problem. One number
has been filled in to get you started.

          x x x     (a)
            x 5     (b)
      ---------
      x x x x x     (c)

DO IT TO IT!
I LIKE TO MOVE IT, MOVE IT!
