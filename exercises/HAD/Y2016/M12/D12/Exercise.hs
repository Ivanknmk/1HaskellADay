Today's Haskell exercise is from the Mensa Genuis Quiz-a-Day book. And I quote:

"Aha," said the math professor to her husband, "it's a very simple problem, but
I see that our two sons have now reached interesting ages. The product of their
ages is six times the amount you get if you add their ages. On the other hand,
if you add the square of each age, the total of the two will be 325." How old
were their boys?

Okay, solve that. ... How?

Question: do you have conversations like this around the dinner table, ...
like I do?
